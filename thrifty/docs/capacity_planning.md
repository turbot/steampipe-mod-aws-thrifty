## Thrifty Capacity Planning Benchmark

Thrifty developers check their long-running resources; itâ€™s a good idea to prepurchase reserved instances at a lower cost. This can apply to long-running resources, including EC2 instances, RDS instances, and Redshift clusters. They should also keep an eye on EC2 reserved instances that are scheduled for expiration or have expired in the preceding 30 days to verify that these cost-savers are no longer needed.
