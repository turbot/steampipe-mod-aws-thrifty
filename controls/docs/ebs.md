# Thrifty DynamoDB Benchmark

Thrifty developers keep a careful eye for unused and under-utilized EBS volumes. Elastic block store is a key component of hidden cost on AWS, and this benchmark looks for EBS volumes that are unused, under-utilized, out-dates and over-sized.

## Help wanted
- add checks for cost allocation tags
