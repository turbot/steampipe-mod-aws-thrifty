# Thrifty S3 Benchmark

Thrifty developers ensure their S3 buckets have managed life-cycles.  This S3 benchmark currently checks that your buckets have a life-cycle policy attached to them.

## Default Thresholds
- None needed to be thrifty!

## Help wanted
- add checks for cost allocation tags
- add checks for development buckets with versioning enabled
