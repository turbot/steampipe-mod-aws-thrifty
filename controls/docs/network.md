# Thrifty Network Benchmark

Thrifty developers ensure that they delete unused network resources. This benchmark focuses on finding resources that are not attached (and therefore not in use).

## Default Thresholds
- None needed to be thrifty!


## Help wanted
- add checks for cost allocation tags
- add checks against data found in vpc flowlogs for unused resources
- add checks for VPCs with no ENIs
